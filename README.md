Overview - 

For this project, I used MongoDB, Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Pandas to analyze JSON data regarding food establishments in the United Kingdom. I first imported the data from a JSON file into a Jupyter Notebook using Mongo Import. I then cleaned up the data by removing some unwanted locations and updating certain fields to be the correct data type to be used for analysis. Finally, I created several DataFrames by limiting and sorting the food establishment data within certain geographical areas and by other specific characteristics seen as ideal for food establishments.
